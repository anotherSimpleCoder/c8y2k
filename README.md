A little tool for making Cumulocity apps easier.
<br>
<br>
This is just a little project I did for myself in order to make it easier to work with Cumulocity's Web SDK (since I work with it on a daily basis). And it will definetly be worked on constantly as I myself learn more and more about Cumulocity over time.

# IMPORTANT
This CLI tool DOES NOT replace Cumulocity's Web SDK CLI. It just simplifies and automates some tasks and only should enhance it a little.
